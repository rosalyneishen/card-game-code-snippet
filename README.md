# card-game-code-snippet
Just a standalone angular component of a card game functionality. 

The goal was to create a standalone component that loads a template of x number of cards formatted into a table.

When clicked, the card content changes to "up" and all other cards face "down". There were no styling requirements here so although the exercise says "card", what you really see is a basic unformatted table in one row.

This code was created during a 30 minute timed coding interview challenge.
